        I am a creative and passionate person who loves designing. I use tools
        like Figma and other editing apps to make designs, especially for
        websites and digital projects. In my free time, I enjoy reading books,
        watching movies, and hanging out with my friends. These hobbies help me
        get new ideas and keep me balanced
